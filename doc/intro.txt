Chapter 7 of this thesis describes the software and its underlying architecture
in some detail.


Input: a single XML data source (for testing, many of the data sources are
	derived form publicly XML document collections
Results: a Huffmann-encoded, highly compressed XML source;
	a set of (index-sequential) index file, the A-, P-, T- and who knows what
	indexes (Chapter 7 knows more about this)



Application

- Sequence of runtime commands to get from XML data source (document collection)
stored in a single XML file and wrapped by a single root element
- Central configuration file with source-specific configurations and a shared
configuration of internal runtime parameters, and file and folder names 

runtime commands

<see document steps.txt in the same directory>


configuration file

(...)
<see sample 'idxr.cfg' in directory /etc>



Notes

I am missing my XML data source CDs, which are in storage boxes somewhere. Need
to pick those up to run full circle tests, whether the code still does what it's
supposed to be.

There's no ant file or other make file included yet. So, the recommended way to
use the code right now is to set up an Eclipse project
